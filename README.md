# AriesPlus4Kit

AriesPlus4Kit is a small collection of example games and utilities for the Commodore Plus/4.
All projects are built on top of the shared aries_utils.c / aries_utils.h foundation, providing a lightweight helper library for graphics, input handling, and general game logic.

The goal of this repository is simple:
give developers an easy starting point for creating their own Plus/4 games.

Currently included:

MagicDice – a 2048-inspired dice-merging puzzle game

GemX Lite – a compact, simplified gem-matching game

(more examples will be added over time)

Each project is kept small, readable, and beginner-friendly.
If you're interested in Plus/4 development or want to explore how simple games can be structured using the Oscar64 compiler, this repository is a great place to start.

Feel free to use these examples as a base for your own ideas!
